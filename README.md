# syna

Syna represents a novel approach to artificial intelligence that mimics human cognitive processing through biomimetic architecture. By reverse-engineering observed cognitive patterns, we've developed a system that implements three distinct processing modes: Convergent (Neurotypical), Divergent (Neurodivergent), and Bilateral (Integrated), each optimized for different types of tasks and problem-solving approaches.
